    <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The Black Sabbath story began in, <i>England, Birmingham</i>, where <b>Ozzy Osbourne</b>, <b>Tony Iommi</b>, <b>Geezer Butler</b> and <b>Bill Ward</b> were looking to escape a life of factory work through music. The four musicians got their start in such psychedelic outfits as the Rare Breed and Mythology (although Osbourne had been a short-haired Mod who loved soul music). <i>Influenced by</i> the reigning British blues bands - Led Zeppelin, Cream, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers - the four of them formed Earth Blues Company (shortened to Earth), in 1968.</p>
        <p><strong>Everything changed when Butler came to the band with an idea for a song inspired by a disturbing apparition</strong>. A fan of horror films and the black magic-themed novels of Dennis Wheatley, he flirted briefly with the black arts. But when he saw what he believed to be a figure from the dark side at the foot of his bed one night, he ceased his dabblings in the goth world. With lyrics by Osbourne, the group composed a song about the visitation, entitling it <strong><i>“Black Sabbath”</i></strong> (after the 1963 Boris Karloff film).</p>
        <p>It provoked a reaction in audiences unlike anything else in their repertoire, and they knew they'd stumbled onto something powerful and unique. Forced to change their name because there was already another band named Earth, they made an obvious choice: <strong><i>Black Sabbath.</i></strong></p>
